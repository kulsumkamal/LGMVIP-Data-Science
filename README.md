Iris dataset Machine Learning project: A dataset containing 150 samples of 3 species with 4 attributes. Analysis of attributes of the Iris plant species with respect to sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width and visualisation. Machine Learning model using K-means Clustering to make predictions.

Stock Market Prediction: Tata Global stock price dataset spanning from 2010 to 2018. Predictions made using Keras Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model.  

Image to pencil sketch: Python was used to convert a JPG image read in RBG format to grayscale, then inverted to enhance details. The final sketch is produced by mixing the grayscale image with the inverted blurry image which done by using the divide function of the cv2 library in Python.
